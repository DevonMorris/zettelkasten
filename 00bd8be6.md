# Ref - Pandoc

Today, I discovered [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/index.html). Like the website
says, Pandoc is a universal document converter implemented in Haskell. I learned
that this is what [Neuron](https://github.com/srid/neuron) uses under the hood
to do its conversion into html.

Anyway, long story made short, I was able to put together a nice looking
presentation in using the [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) output in a few
minutes. It could also be a good tool to convert zettels into presentations.

I'll probably write more about this tool in the future as I become more
comfortable with it.
