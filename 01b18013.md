# Post - Building a new keyboard!

Previously, I talked a little bit about my current keyboard[^keeb] and why I
liked it. Well, I like the corne keyboard so much, that I'm building another
one (my wife made me swear this would be my last build). This will allow me to
have the same keyboard at work and home, which will be super nice.

Furthermore, it's really nice to work with my hands and build something
physical. I enjoy programming, but in most cases, code is far less tangible
than building a physical object.

So I'm taking my experience building 2 other keyboards,[^2] and making
one last keyboard.

Once again, I am making a corne keyboard. I've got some tricks up my sleeve for
this build and going to try some new things. Here is a basic parts list.

* [Corne PCBs](https://keyhive.xyz/shop/hotswap-corne-helidox)
* [Corne Acrylic Plates](https://keyhive.xyz/shop/corne-acrylic-plates)
* [Glorious Panda Switches](https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-panda-mechanical-switches)
* [Lubrication Station](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08JLJZ95Z/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Krytox 205g0](https://www.amazon.com/Krytox-Grease-Pure-PFPE-PTFE/dp/B00MWLDALQ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=krytox+205g0&pd_rd_r=54e91049-0511-469c-8e59-ded0f2f5aa08&pd_rd_w=8rcUH&pd_rd_wg=1U5sj&pf_rd_p=4fa0e97a-13a4-491b-a127-133a554b4da3&pf_rd_r=7SXDCFKH1KBSY314833A&qid=1616876097&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFLUFpFVlJXSVY0TFAmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA1MzYwNDRCM0g5V0tPRFZMRFAmZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDYzNDgyMU9PUEdJMEdDTjUwRCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=)

* [MT3 White on Black](https://drop.com/buy/drop-mt3-white-on-black-keycap-set)

I already have a soldering iron, solder, flux and digital multimeter, but if you
want to replicate this build, you will want those as well.
