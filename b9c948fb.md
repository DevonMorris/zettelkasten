# Principle - Zettelkasten is a procedure

Engineers love the [[feb9e7b6]] method of note taking.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering) describes engineering as
"the use of scientific principles to design and build machines, structures, and
other items." [[1b538dd2]] concerns itself with patterns, creation and
process.

When I write engineer, I ask "what's the procedure?" and "what process should I
follow?" I'm concerned with the series of steps that I must take to complete a
task.

In this manner, [[feb9e7b6]] is _fairly_ prescriptive. There are two main
steps in the process.
* Make notes and connect those notes to other notes in a structured manner
  (using links and tags).
* Upon reviewing your notes peruse the links and tags and see if there are any
  new connections made.

That's it! Two easy steps to follow! Each person[^me] can tweak this process and
define their method of linking and tagging.
