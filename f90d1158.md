# My Zettelkasten Graph

A zettelkasten is a directed graph.[^graph] Here you can explore[^controls] my zettelkasten
in a graphical fashion.

``` {=html}
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v6.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./static/graph.css">
<script src="./static/graph.js" type="module"></script>
```

[^graph]: [[b98dd107]]
[^controls]: Drag to pin a node. Ctrl + Click to unpin a node. Double click node to view note. Nodes are colored and sized based on incoming degree, so notes more heavily linked to will grow in relative size.
