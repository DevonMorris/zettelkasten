# Post - tmux numbering
Quick tip, tmux starts with 0. This feels weird with
[awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org/) since tags start at 1. The fix
is to put

```
# Correct numbering of windows and panes
set -g base-index 1
setw -g pane-base-index 1
```

in your `.tmux.conf`. You can see my entire tmux configuration on
[github](https://github.com/DevonMorris/dotfiles/blob/master/.tmux.conf)
