# Post - Docker Neovim Telescope Extension

I use docker quite a bit for my job and haven't yet found a workflow for it that
_feels_ good. I was looking through
[telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) today and
I don't think it'll be too hard to make a fully feature docker plugin that
integrates with the fuzzy finding telescope provides. Here's a list of features
I'd want.

## Containers
* List all containers `docker container ls -a`
* Support stop, start, restart, kill and rm
* support exec with arbitrary command (not interactive)
  - Would be nice to have _immediate_ feedback if this fails (command doesn't exist or something)
* support attaching to tty and _maybe_ customizable shell (`termopen()`)
* support opening log of containers

## Images
* List all images `docker image ls` (filter the none shit)
* rmi for images
* support run with arbitrary command (not interactive)
* support running new interactive container and attaching to tty and _maybe_ customizable shell (`termopen()`)

## Usability
* configurable prefix and mappings
  - should I even give default mappings (probably since actions are a thing)
* previewer should be logs if available

## Unsolved mysteries
* supporting additional arguments, such as
  - volumes
  - environment variables
  - Basically anything you see under `docker run --help`

## Docker Compose???
* Don't know jack about this, probably will come later

## Way Future Crazy Ideas that I don't even know if they would work (might have to be separate plugin)
* Choose to run lsp in a docker container.[^complications]

## First steps
* probably just get stuff showing up in tele and learning more about the tele api and lua

## Random thougts
* Need a photoshopped image of a whale on a telescope

[^complications]: Lots of complexity here regarding JSON RPC and mapping volumes see [clangd mailing list](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/clangd-dev/2019-January/000231.html)
