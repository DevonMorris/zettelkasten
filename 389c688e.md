# Post - Netrw and Jumps
I want to get away from using splits in vim because largely they are
unnecessary and you can't _really_ look at two things at once.[^git] So I
wanted to limit my split usage to things like commit messages and help menu.
I was annoyed when I would open netrw with `:Ex` and then was not able to
jump back to my previous file with `<c-o>` if I decided not to open a new file.

So here's the solution. Make a `ftplugin/netrw.vim` that looks like
```vim
noremap <buffer> <C-O> <CMD>e#<CR>
```

Boom, you can jump back to the file from whence you came.

[^git]: Yeah the one exception to this is merge conflicts and diffs
