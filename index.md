# Devon Morris

Sofware minimalism and craftmanship is my thing. I love linux, vim and the
open-source movement. My goal is to create simple, generic, and highly-flexible
systems to solve the biggest problems in autonomy and robotics.

Here I keep my [zettlekasten](https://neuron.zettel.page/zettelkasten) style
notes.

## Posts
Here are posts more in the form of a blog post or life events. Basically, it's
a space for me to conjecture, rant, reflect and pontificate.

## Notes
Here are a few of my interests. I collect notes here as I learn more about these
topics.
