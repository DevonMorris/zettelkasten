# Post - tmux
I've been digging into tmux recently and _honestly_ it's a game changer. Check
out my [tmux config](https://github.com/DevonMorris/dotfiles/blob/master/.tmux.conf).
Combined with [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) I've really
automated some workflow for my projects. Plus hitting `ctrl+b` on my
keyboard[^keeb] feels so good.
