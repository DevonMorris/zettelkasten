![Me](./static/me.jpeg)

## Who am I?
Sofware minimalism and craftmanship is my thing. I love linux, neovim and the
open-source movement. I strive for relentless improvement and efficiency in my
work and personal life. My goal is to create simple, generic, and
highly-flexible systems to solve the biggest problems in autonomy and robotics.
Currently, I work for [Torc Robotics](https://torc.ai/) as a perception
engineer.

I am a husband to a wonderful wife and a father to two young boys. I love
spending time with my family and seeing the world through my kids eyes.

## Posts
Here are posts more in the form of a blog post or life events. Basically, it's
a space for me to conjecture, rant, reflect and pontificate.

## Notes
Here are a few of my interests. I collect notes here as I learn more about these
topics.
