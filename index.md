# 👋🏼 I'm Devon Morris  👋🏼

![Me](./static/me.jpeg)

## ✨ I'm a Dreamer
Sofware minimalism and craftmanship is my thing. I love linux, neovim and the
open-source movement. I strive for relentless improvement and efficiency in my
work and personal life. My goal is to create simple, generic, and
highly-flexible systems to solve the biggest problems in autonomy and robotics.

## 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 I'm a family man

I am a husband to a wonderful wife and a father to two young boys. I love
spending time with my family and seeing the world through my kids eyes.

## 🧠 I'm a thinker
Here are posts in the form of a mini-blog and life updates. Basically this is a
place for me to conjecture, rant, reflect and pontificate.
