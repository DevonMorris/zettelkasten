# Post - My Method of Zettelkasten

I mentioned in my previous post[^prev], that I wanted to use zettelkasten for 3
main purposes.
* Notes attached to resources I have found
* Freeform thoughts
* Distilled principles

This _roughly_ describes the information flow in my brain as I attempt to refine
and distill information and add to my zettelkasten. As such, I'll title any
zettels in one of five categories
* Ref
* Notes
* Post
* Principle
* Tag

The first four markers exist irrespective of tags or links. They serve as an additional
marker to indicate the refinement similar to Coal vs Graphite vs Diamond.
Generally, notes are interpreted as ideas mostly from others with a few personal
insights. Posts are my struggles in combining these ideas in a medium-form
microblog post. Principles are succinct atomic[^atomic] and autonomous ideas.
My conjecture is that principles will be powerful connection points in the
topology of my notes. References are primary sources that I have not yet
distilled/refined into my own words.

From reading a bit on zettels, I've realized that both tags and links are very
important[^math] in forming an effective zettelkasten. As such, I have defined some
key tags[^tags]
[[z:zettels?tag=hub]]
Additionally, I may have other tags more narrow[^narrow] in scope,

I manually create links when I find two notes are related. This might be done
at the time of writing, or later when I go back and read my notes. This idea
has strong parallels to
[neuroplasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity) for me.

I also don't impose structure as I store these notes. This means that my
directory full of zettels is completely flat and randomly named. Thus, zettels
should have their dependencies modeled solely in terms of links and tags and
not directory structure.

[^atomic]: [Atomic and Autonomous Notes](https://neuron.zettel.page/atomic)
[^tags]: In practice I'm using [neuron's](https://github.com/srid/neuron) folgezettel links to connect tags to their "hub" page. This is merely for convenience and display. There is a one-to-one correspondence to tags (not named hub) and these "landing pages".
[^math]: There is a mathematical justification here that I'm distilling and will link here.
[^narrow]: Practically, this looks like another tag. E.g. for programming languages I'd have the tag `pl` and for C++ specific information it would be `pl-cpp`
