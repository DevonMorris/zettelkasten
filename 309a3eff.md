# Principle - Notes in a Zettelkasten can be ranked

Previously, we determined that a zettelkasten was a directed graph[^graph].
Since a zettelkasten is a directed graph, we can run standard graph algorithms
on the graph. One of the most well known graph algorithms is [Page
Rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank).[^rank][^markov]

As an incredibly brief review:

>  PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to
>  determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying
>  assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links
>  from other websites.

The key word to examine here is "important." Important in this context means
the probability of landing on the page after a large number of clicks.

What does this mean in the context of zettelkasten? Page Rank can provide a
steady-state distribution to your notes and ideas. Ideas with a higher
probability are more important in connecting your ideas. Perhaps these are
core competencies, central axioms or key assumptions of our world-view! I hope
to explore this when I have a mature zettelkasten!

[^graph]: [[b98dd107]]
[^rank]: Ignore everything webpage or hypertext specific in the wikipedia article. In the [other uses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank#Other_uses) section is broadens the applicability of the algorithm to "any graph or network in any domain"
[^markov]: Note to self, it might be interesting to jump deeper into the markov theory and algorithm and do some notes on that.
