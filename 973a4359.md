# Principle - We can determine distance between ideas in a Zettelkasten

Previously, we determined that a zettelkasten was a directed graph[^graph]. As
such, we can run standard graph algorithms on the graph. For example, we can
determine the distance between two notes in a zettelkasten by using [dijkstra's
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm).[^assumptions]

So in general we have a set of notes $N$ and a way to measure some distance
between notes $d$. What does this distance tell us? It should give us a _rough_
idea of how related two notes are. There are a few things we can do with this
distance[^distance].
* We can compute the max distance (diameter) of the graph.
  * This could be a measure of breadth of knowledge
* We can compute the central vertex
  * This could represent a super key idea, assumption or world-view
* We could compute the peripheral vertices
  * These could provide us with points to research to expand our knowledge further

Furthermore, this distance $d$ obeys the properties of a metric space[^metric]
(yes, check them). So our Zettelkasten is a metric space! Pretty cool!

[^assumptions]: Yeah we are going to assume the zettelkasten is [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory), if it's not then just split it into distinct connected components and treat them as separate zettelkasten., if it's not then just split it into distinct connected components and treat them as separate zettelkasten., if it's not then just split it into distinct connected components and treat them as separate zettelkasten., if it's not then just split it into distinct connected components and treat them as separate zettelkasten.
