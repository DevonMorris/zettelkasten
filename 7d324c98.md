# Post - My Practice of Zettelkasten

Previously, I talked about my method[^method] of writing notes. Here's where
I'll talk more about what steps I take to practice and implement this method.

I'm a huge fan of neovim. I sponsor the project and am super pleased with how
using neovim has changed my workflow. I actually found this method of note
taking on the [awesome-neovim](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim)
repository. It mentions a plugin
[neuron.nvim](https://github.com/oberblastmeister/neuron.nvim), which led me
finally to [neuron](https://github.com/srid/neuron) and the zettelkasten
approach for note-taking.[^brain]

That being said, these are the tools I use to write my zettels. Neuron, Neovim
and some fancy git hooks magic. The neuron neovim plugin[^plugin] provides excellent
keybindings and [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
integration for fuzzy finding zettels.

I test the zettel locally on the local server and then deploy using this
post-receive git hook

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# The production directory
TARGET="/var/www/devonmorris.dev"
# A temporary directory for deployment
TEMP="/tmp/devonmorris.dev"
# The Git repo
REPO="/srv/git/zettelkasten.git"
# Deploy the content to the temporary directory
mkdir -p $TEMP
git --work-tree=$TEMP --git-dir=$REPO checkout -f

# Deploy to github as well
git push github -f --all

# Generate site with neuron
if [ -e /home/git/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh ]; then . /home/git/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh; fi
cd $TEMP
neuron gen -o $TARGET
```

With that I can create a new note quickly with my keybindings and link notes
with a different binding. This makes writing notes, making connections and
updating the website a breeze!

[^brain]: This paragraph should be a testament to the efficacy of zettelkasten. There is probably some comparison to be made to the www being a shared zettelkasten for all people. This goes deep. Shared cognition. Society mimicking the brain. Conway's law.
[^plugin]: My [configuration](https://github.com/DevonMorris/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/nvim/lua/config/neuron.lua) for this plugin
